        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F. In a large skillet, cook the ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until no pink remains. Drain the fat.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato sauce, tomato paste, basil, oregano, and red pepper flakes to the skillet. Stir to combine. Simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, 1/2 cup of the mozzarella cheese, and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese. Stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9×13-inch baking dish. Layer with 3 lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, and 1 cup of the meat sauce. Repeat the layers twice more.</li>
            <li>Top with the remaining 3 lasagna noodles and the remaining meat sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.</li>
            <li>Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
